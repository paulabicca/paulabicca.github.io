If you’re a front-end developer, you’ve likely noticed that “front-end developer” job postings are becoming increasingly rare. Nowadays, the market seeks developers proficient in **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**, and experience with **JavaScript** is often considered a “plus” or not even required. This raises the question: is Vanilla JavaScript really "dead"?

## What is Vanilla JavaScript?

"Vanilla JavaScript" refers to using JavaScript in its pure form, without relying on additional frameworks or libraries. It’s the basic JavaScript language that can be executed directly in the browser, without tools like **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**.

When we talk about Vanilla JavaScript, we mean leveraging the language's native features, utilizing browser APIs, and relying on fundamental JavaScript capabilities.

## Why Have Frameworks Dominated Front-End Development?

It’s easy to see why frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue.js** have become so dominant. These frameworks offer several advantages, especially for large-scale projects, such as:

- **Componentization:** Structures that make code more modular and reusable.
- **State Management:** Tools to handle complex states in large applications.
- **Improved Performance:** Algorithms that update the DOM more efficiently.
- **Ease of Development:** Ready-to-use features like routing and form validation, saving development time.

These functionalities have made developers’ lives significantly easier and accelerated the development of complex applications. It’s no surprise that frameworks like React have become the preferred choice for many companies and developers.

## So, Is Vanilla JavaScript Really "Dead"?

The answer is **no**. While the job market focuses on frameworks, **Vanilla JavaScript** remains highly relevant. According to [GitHub metrics for 2024](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/programming-languages), JavaScript is still one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Even with the rise of [TypeScript](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/), which adds static typing to JavaScript, knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript remains essential.

JavaScript is the foundation of modern frameworks. Even if you’re working with React or Vue, it’s crucial to understand how the **DOM** works, how to manipulate elements, and grasp fundamental JavaScript concepts that are key to working effectively with these frameworks.

## What Is the Future of Vanilla JavaScript?

With 25 years of existence and a vast community behind it, JavaScript offers a wide range of options and tools for developers of all levels, from beginners to experts. Its flexibility allows it to run both on the client side and the server side, adapting to various project needs.

Contrary to what some might think, JavaScript remains a solid foundation for anyone who wants to deeply understand how the web works. With advancements in **APIs** and the introduction of modern features like **ES6+**, the language has become even more powerful and practical. The community has also contributed significantly, creating an extensive array of plugins, libraries, and frameworks that have cemented JavaScript as an essential language for web development.

Moreover, trends like **Web Components** — a native specification for creating reusable components — are encouraging the use of Vanilla JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. This reaffirms that even in more advanced development scenarios, JavaScript will remain relevant and fundamental.

## Frameworks or JavaScript?

If you’re starting in web development, it’s natural to ask: "Where should I begin?" The answer depends on your time and goals.

If you have time, it’s ideal to start with **JavaScript**. It is the foundation of everything in web development, and mastering Vanilla JavaScript will make it easier to learn any framework or library in the future.

However, if time is limited and you need to start with a framework, pick your favorite. But even then, don’t neglect studying JavaScript in parallel. This knowledge will be essential for your growth as a developer, helping you solidify the foundation upon which frameworks are built.
